# Experiments with websockets

The files here are not part of the app, but just some tests to get the HTTP and
WebSocket servers working.

Start the server with `node server.js`. Next, you can start a client in
several ways:

* Using a separate bash terminal: `node client.js` or `node w3c-client.js`.
  The latter uses the same API as is used by browsers.
* Open the `browser.html` file directly in a browser (File -> Open). That
  will load the JS code in `browser-client.js`.
